## 📌 Overview
This repository contains all code, datasets, model outputs, and analysis for our project:

**“Legal Machine Translation for Indian Judicial Texts:  
A Comparative Study of OPUS-MT and NLLB-200 for English–Hindi Translation.”**

We fine-tuned two neural machine translation models:

1. **OPUS-MT (Helsinki NLP)** – lightweight bilingual Transformer  
2. **NLLB-200 (Distilled 600M)** – large multilingual Transformer from Meta

Both models were trained and evaluated on **Indian legal-domain parallel data**, including court judgments and legal proceedings.
